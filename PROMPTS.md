## Example Prompts Used

### Architecure & Design
```
 I'm building a serverless voice memo processing system on Cloudflare and need
  guidance on how to properly integrate all the pieces together.

  Here's what I'm trying to build:
  - Users upload audio files through a REST API endpoint
  - The system processes these asynchronously using a workflow
  - Results are stored in a database and accessible via another endpoint

  I'm planning to use:
  - Cloudflare Workers - The main API runtime
  - Cloudflare D1 - SQLite database for storing task metadata and results
  - Cloudflare R2 - Object storage for audio files
  - Cloudflare Workflows - For orchestrating the async processing pipeline
  - Cloudflare Queues - For triggering workflows asynchronously
  - Workers AI - For Whisper and Llama model inference

  My questions:

  1. Data Flow & Architecture:
     - Should the Worker stream directly to R2, or buffer in memory first?
     - How should I handle the transition from the HTTP request handler to
       the queue/workflow?
     - What's the best way to update D1 records as the workflow progresses?
     - How do I keep database state consistent across multiple workflow steps?

  2. Worker Configuration:
     - How do I bind D1, R2, Workflows, and Queues to my Worker?
     - Should I use separate Workers for the API vs queue consumer, or
       combine them in one?
     - How do I handle environment-specific configs (dev vs production)?
     - What's the best pattern for organizing handlers across multiple files?

  3. Database Design:
     - What columns should the tasks table have to track processing status?
     - How should I handle eventual consistency between workflow updates
       and database reads?
     - Should I store the full audio metadata in D1 or just the R2 reference?
     - What indexes would help with query performance?

  4. Queue & Workflow Best Practices:
     - How do I structure the message payload sent to the queue?
     - Should the workflow be triggered by the queue or called directly from
       the Worker?
     - How do I handle retry logic if the workflow fails?
     - What's the best way to monitor workflow execution?

  5. R2 & File Handling:
     - How should I name/organize files in R2 buckets?
     - What's the best way to handle large uploads without timing out?
     - Should I set object metadata for tracking ownership?
     - How do I implement cleanup/deletion of old files?

  6. Error Handling & Resilience:
     - What should happen if the queue message fails to send?
     - How do I handle R2 upload failures?
     - What's the pattern for handling partial workflow failures?
     - How do I make the API idempotent for retries?

  7. Security & Best Practices:
     - How should I authenticate/authorize user requests?
     - How do I prevent one user from accessing another's data?
     - Should I validate audio file type/size on upload?
     - What's the recommended approach for rate limiting?

  Can you provide:
  - A detailed architecture diagram showing component interactions
  - Sample code patterns for Worker bindings and configuration
  - Database schema that supports this workflow
  - Examples of queue messages and workflow step organization
  - Best practices specific to each Cloudflare service
```

### Documentation
```
Here's an expanded prompt for creating the README:

  I need help creating a comprehensive README for my Cloudflare Workers
  voice memo project. The project is complete and deployed, and I want a
  README that explains what it is, how it works, and what it can do.

  Here's what I need the README to cover:

  1. Project Title & Description:
     - Clear, concise title that explains what the project does
     - One-liner summary of the main value proposition
     - Brief overview of the problem it solves

  2. Quick Overview:
     - Visual flowchart showing the user journey (upload → transcribe → extract →
  generate → view)
     - High-level explanation of what makes this project special
     - Link to live demo at: https://master.voice-memo-frontend.pages.dev/

  3. Features Section:
     - List of key capabilities with brief descriptions
     - Focus on what users can DO, not just technical features
     - Include: voice upload, AI transcription, task extraction, content generation,
       user isolation, async processing, serverless architecture

  4. Tech Stack:
     - Clear list of all Cloudflare services used
     - Explain briefly why each was chosen
     - Include: Workers, D1, R2, Queues, Workflows, Workers AI

  5. Monorepo Structure Note:
     - Explain that this is a pnpm workspaces monorepo
     - List the three packages: @project/shared, @project/backend, @project/frontend
     - Point to detailed documentation about the structure

  6. Architecture Diagram:
     - Show the data flow from user upload through to results
     - Include all components: Worker, Queue, Workflow, AI models, Database, Storage
     - ASCII art or text-based diagram is fine

  7. **Project Structure**:
     - Directory tree showing code organization
     - Brief comments explaining what each file/folder does
     - Help developers quickly locate where to make changes

  8. Contributing:
     - Simple guidelines for how to contribute
     - Mention forking, feature branches, testing, and PRs

  9. License:
     - Show MIT license

  10. Support:
      - Links to GitHub issues and Cloudflare docs

  11. Acknowledgments:
      - Credit Cloudflare services
      - Note that AI (Claude) assisted with development

  12. Tone & Style:
      - Professional but approachable
      - Assume reader has basic web development knowledge
      - Use emojis for features (optional, but can help readability)
      - Keep it scannable with good headers and formatting

  Can you write a README that:
  - Is visually appealing and easy to scan
  - Explains the project to both technical and non-technical audiences
  - Gives developers enough info to understand the codebase structure
  - Includes a clear path to the live demo
  - Highlights that this is built on Cloudflare serverless
  - Acknowledges AI assistance in development
  - Uses Markdown formatting effectively
```

**Note:** While AI significantly assisted in this project's development, all code has been reviewed and tested. The human developer remains responsible for the final implementation, testing, and deployment decisions.
