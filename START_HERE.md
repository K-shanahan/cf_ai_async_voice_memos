# 🎯 START HERE - Voice Memo Task Manager Monorepo

## What Happened?

Your repository has been **successfully converted** from a single backend project to a **pnpm workspaces monorepo** with:
- ✅ **Backend** (Cloudflare Workers) - Fully functional
- ✅ **Frontend** (React) - Scaffolded and ready to build
- ✅ **Shared** - Types and utilities for both

## In 5 Minutes

```bash
# 1. Install (first time only)
pnpm install

# 2. Start developing
pnpm dev:backend      # Terminal 1
pnpm dev:frontend     # Terminal 2

## What Is a Monorepo?

A monorepo is a single repository containing multiple projects (packages). Benefits:
- 📦 Share code easily between projects
- 🔗 Single installation of dependencies
- 📜 Unified build process
- 🚀 Independent deployments

Your monorepo has three packages:
1. `@project/backend` - API server
2. `@project/frontend` - Web app
3. `@project/shared` - Shared code
