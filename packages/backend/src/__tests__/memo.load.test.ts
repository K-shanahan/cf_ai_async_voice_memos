/**
 * Load and boundary tests for large files.
 *
 * These tests are intentionally separated from the main integration tests because:
 * 1. They allocate large amounts of memory (50-51MB buffers)
 * 2. They can be slow and resource-intensive
 * 3. They are best run nightly or separately from the main test suite
 * 4. They test infrastructure (file size limits) rather than application logic
 *
 * CRITICAL: These tests must verify end-to-end processing success, not just
 * that the gateway accepts the payload. A 202 response only means the request
 * was received - it says nothing about whether the async worker can process
 * the large file within its memory and execution time constraints.
 *
 * Run with: npm test -- memo.load.test.ts
 * Or schedule for nightly CI runs only.
